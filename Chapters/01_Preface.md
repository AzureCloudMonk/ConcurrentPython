Preface
=======

> This is an intermediate-to-advanced book on concurrency in Python.

The reader is assumed to be fluent in the Python language before reading this
book. There are a large number of resources available to achieve this fluency,
many of them free.

In addition, I use the latest version of Python available at this writing,
version 3.6, which includes important concurrency features. If you are wedded to
an earlier version of Python, this book might not be for you.

eBook First
-----------

This book is developed in the open, as an eBook.

At the 2016 Pycon in Portland, I held an open-spaces session around this book,
and also attended a dinner where we talked about it. In both cases people argued
that, while they really liked the idea of a free eBook, eventually they want a
print book. Once the eBook version has been out long enough to get adequate
feedback to evolve and eliminate errors, I will revisit the issue and consider
creating a print version of the book.

Business Model

Colophon
--------

This book was written with Pandoc-flavored Markdown, and produced into ePub
version 3 format using [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/).

The body font is Georgia and the headline font is Verdana. The code font is
Ubuntu Mono, because it is especially compact and allows more characters on a
line without wrapping. I chose to place the code inline (rather than make
listings into images, as I've seen some books do) because it was important to me
that the reader be able to resize the font of the code listings when they resize
the body font (otherwise, really, what's the point?).

The build process for the book was automated, as well as the process to extract,
compile and test the code examples. All automation was achieved through fairly
extensive programs I wrote in Python 3.
