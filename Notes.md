Calling Go from Python:

For windows it would have to be done in the bash shell but that might be OK

If tasks don’t wait on each other then they are compute intensive

Ideally, make tasks that don’t block on other tasks (deadlock prone)

The concept of whether something is synchronous refers to when a function
finishes vs. when a function returns. In the vast majority of Python code these
two points are identical, a.k.a synchronous: a function returns when it
finishes. But with an asynchronous call, the function returns control to the
caller *before* the function finishes---typically much sooner. So the two
events, returning and finishing, now happen at different points in time: they
are *asynchronous*.
