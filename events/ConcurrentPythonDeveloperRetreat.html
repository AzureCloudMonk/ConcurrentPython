### The Retreat

We'll be exploring topics and tools around my book project
<a href="http://www.ConcurrentPython.com">Concurrent Python</a>.
Although I've added material based on the *Concurrency* chapter from
<a href="www.OnJava8.com">On Java 8</a>,
this book is still in its research and organization phase; I expect it to be a couple of
years before I consider it finished. The electronic version of the book is meant to
be publicly available during and after development. The book is written in (Pandoc-flavored)
Markdown so you can read it directly in the Github repository.

**Prerequisites**: The book is intended for readers who know Python but don't know anything about
concurrency. Thus, for the retreat you should know Python, but I don't expect any concurrency knowledge.

-   Miguel Grinberg's [Asynchronous Python for the Complete Beginner](
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG6fr81xHKA) is a nice
    overview of some of the core concepts.

### Location

-   Bruce Eckel&rsquo;s living room, Crested Butte, CO (WiFi, TV Monitor w/ Chromecast, Printer/Scanner and
    Kitchen). We can comfortably fit 12 people.

-   For variety, we go to coffee shops and group houses.

-   If people are staying in the hostel, that has a nice community space as well.

-   &ldquo;Townie&rdquo; bikes can be rented during the event to more easily get around town.

-   **Note:** Although you can find lodging &mdash; even nice hotels &mdash; up on the mountain
    (called *Mount* Crested Butte, 3 miles away with a free bus running to town), it's much nicer
    to stay in town (just called "Crested Butte," no "Mount"), so try to do that if you can.
